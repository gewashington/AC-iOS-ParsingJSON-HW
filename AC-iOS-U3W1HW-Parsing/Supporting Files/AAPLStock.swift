/*
 VC
 A table view
 The table view should list each stock price in order from oldest to newest. Each table view cell should contain the date and the opening stock price. Feel free to use a default TableViewCell (e.g you don't need to create you own subclass).
 
 The table view should also have sections. Every month and year should have its own section. The title for the section should display the month and year as well as the average for all stock opening prices that month.
 
 Detail VC
 A UIImage
 A label to represent the date
 Two labels to represent the opening and closing prices
 If the stock price went up that day, set the background color to green and make the image a thumbs up.
 If the stock price went down that day, set the background color to red and make the image a thumbs down.
